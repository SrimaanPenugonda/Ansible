Problems with shell scripting
shell scripting is  Imperative
Ansible is declarative
    user sample - to add sample - this will check the OS , version all and add the user irrespective of
    user add command
Shell Scripting works on one operating system
    Ansible can work on any operating system - Heterogeneous
Shell scripting is sequential
    Ansible is parallel operations
Shell Script code has to be locally available

Configuration Management Tools
    Puppet,Ansible etc

Ansible -
    Declarative
    Heterogeneous
    Parallel operations
    Not be on the local sever
Ansible is better tool than puppet

Diff B/W Pull and Push
Ansible - push the command to node (push- primary, pull - second)
Chef and puppet - pull mechanism - pull the info from nodes and give commands

INVENTORY-
    List of servers managed by ansible has to provided with file inventory
    LIST OF SERVERS mentioned here- hostnames,ip addresses
    best practice - dev,prod diff inventory files
